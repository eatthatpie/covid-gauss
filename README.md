# COVID-19 timeline prediction with Gaussian curve

Data about confirmed cases (day by day) is fetched from [CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and updated daily.

Estimates are made by approximating the actual data for each day to Gaussian curve.

Predictions are based on a mathematical model and should not be considered a reliable source.
